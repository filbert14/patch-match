An implementation of [PatchMatch: A Randomized Correspondence Algorithm for Structural Image Editing](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Barnes_2009_PAR/patchmatch.pdf), ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH), August 2009 by Connelly Barnes, Eli Shechtman, Adam Finkelstein, and Dan B Goldman, written in C++ using [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) and [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

The implementation is mainly inspired by the standard PatchMatch algorithm implemented in the following [repository](https://github.com/MingtaoGuo/PatchMatch), example images were all taken from [https://www.rawpixel.com/](https://www.rawpixel.com/).
